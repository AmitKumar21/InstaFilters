# InstaFilters
I am using ButterKnife,Dexter and AndroidHive library fro better performance.
 I considered using the image filters library AndroidPhotoFilters developed by Zomato. This library offers basic image operations like controlling Brightness, Saturation, Contrast and few image filters. Combining all these features together, you can create your won filters.
